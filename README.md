# Intelligent-Naviagtor

It is a well known fact that one of the major challenges encountered by a visually challenged person,is finding right path to his destination either in an indoor or outdoor environment. This project “Intelligent navigator” is an electronic travel aid to assist visually challenged people to find their path. It serves as an enhancement to the normal obstacle detection along with navigation to the user most frequent visited places. As each person has different pace in walking, two modes are maintained, namely Training Mode and Working Mode. In Training mode the user will initially set the estimated time to reach the landmarks to the destination. In working mode the intelligent navigator helps the user to navigate from source location to destination location by providing voice messages regarding the landmarks identified.
